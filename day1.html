        <div class="question">1Ô∏è‚É£ You need to determine which plastic is contaminating the river. You suspect it to be either Polyethylene or Polystyrene ‚Äî but only one will float in water. Use your understanding of water‚Äôs density and the molecular structure of plastics to justify your answer.</div>
